# Cartography with JavaScript: A Comprehensive Self-Study Guide

## Overview
This guide will enable you to leverage JavaScript for map creation and manipulation, harnessing the power of geospatial data, advanced processing techniques, and popular mapping libraries. Given your prior experience in software engineering and web development, this guide focuses on the specialized aspects of map creation rather than basic JavaScript or web development principles.
