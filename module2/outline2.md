### Module 2: Processing Geospatial Data
#### 2.1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing in JavaScript
Geospatial data often requires some degree of cleaning and preprocessing before it can be used. This could involve filtering out irrelevant data, handling missing values, or converting data into a more useful format.
For instance, you might have a dataset with missing or inconsistent entries that you need to clean up. You could use JavaScript's built-in methods along with libraries such as [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) or [Underscore.js](https://underscorejs.org/) to process arrays and objects.
Here's an example of how you might clean up a GeoJSON object with missing properties:
```javascript
let geojson = {
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "name": "San Francisco"
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-122.4194, 37.7749]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {}, // Missing 'name'
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-118.2437, 34.0522]
      }
    }
  ]
};

geojson.features.forEach(feature => {
  if (!feature.properties.name) {
    feature.properties.name = "Unknown location";
  }
});

```
In this example, we iterate over the features in the GeoJSON object and fill in a default value for any missing `name` properties.
#### 2.2 Data Transformation and Geospatial Analysis
Once your data is clean, you may need to transform it to suit your needs. This could involve changing the format, aggregating data, or performing more complex geospatial operations.
For instance, you might use a library like [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) to perform geospatial analysis on your data. Turf.js provides a wide range of geospatial operations such as measuring distance, creating buffers, finding intersections, etc.
Here's an example of how you might calculate the distance between two points using Turf.js:
```javascript
const turf = require('@turf/turf');

let point1 = turf.point([-122.4194, 37.7749]); // San Francisco
let point2 = turf.point([-118.2437, 34.0522]); // Los Angeles

let options = {units: 'miles'};

let distance = turf.distance(point1, point2, options);

console.log(`Distance: ${distance} miles`);

```
In this example, we use Turf.js to create two point features and then calculate the distance between them in miles.
#### 2.3 Understanding and Using Geospatial Libraries (Turf.js)
In addition to data cleaning and transformation, you'll often need to perform more complex operations on your data. Libraries like Turf.js can be incredibly helpful for this.
Turf.js is a modular geospatial engine written in JavaScript. It includes traditional spatial operations, helper functions for creating GeoJSON data, and data classification and statistics tools.
We've already seen how you can use Turf.js to calculate distances. You can also use it to create buffers, find the midpoint between two points, calculate areas, and much more. Check out the [Turf.js documentation](http://turfjs.org/docs/) for more details and examples.
#### Exercises
1. **Data Cleaning**: Write a JavaScript function that takes a GeoJSON object as input, checks for missing or null property values, and fills them in with default values. You can use the example provided as a starting point, but try to make your function more general so it can handle any property, not just the 'name'.
```javascript
// Example function structure
function cleanGeoJSON(geojson) {
    // Your code here
}

```
2. **Data Transformation**: Using Turf.js, write a JavaScript function that takes two GeoJSON points and returns the midpoint between them.
```javascript
// Example function structure
function getMidpoint(point1, point2) {
    // Your code here
}

```
3. **Geospatial Libraries**: Explore the Turf.js documentation and find a function that you find interesting. Write a JavaScript function that uses this Turf.js function to perform a geospatial operation.
```javascript
// Example function structure
function performOperation(feature1, feature2) code here
}

```
Remember, these are just function structures. You'll need to fill in the actual implementation depending on what you want to achieve.
